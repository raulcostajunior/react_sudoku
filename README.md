### Live Demo

A demo of this application is available at http://play-sudoku.herokuapp.com.

The application's purpose is to demo the functionalities in [api-sudoku](http://github.com/raulcostajunior/api_sudoku) which, in turn, is based on [libsudoku](http://github.com/raulcostajunior/libsudoku).

This is not really a game - lots of "gamifications" should be put in place before calling it a game.
