This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Live Demo

A demo of this application can be seem at http://play-sudoku.herokuapp.com.

The application's purpose is to demo the functionalities in api-sudoku.herokuapp.com. This is not a full blown game yet and will probably never be.

I don't think yet another Sudoku game is needed; all the work I did on libsudoku, api-sudoku and on this web application has been done to get a hold of the technologies involved.
